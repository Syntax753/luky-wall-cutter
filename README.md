# Luky Wall Cutter

## Purpose

Defining cutouts for walls often requires manual sketches on paper, and then passing the sketches to the wall cutters.

This can be time-consuming.

Luky is designed to be easy to host, and accessible via a mobile link. Screenshots can then be taken of the cutout shapes after the dimensions are entered.

## Guide

1. Select your cut-out shape
2. Add the dimensions, either via the text boxes or directly on the preview
3. Rotate the cut-out as required
4. Take a screenshot
5. Send to the wall cutter
